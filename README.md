## 🎯 Why DeployX?

Deploying applications should be fast, intuitive, and stress-free.  
DeployX was built to solve the pain points of:

- Manually configuring Dockerfiles and build environments  
- Struggling with cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, or Azure  
- Repeating tedious deployment steps for every project  
- Sharing demos and MVPs quickly during hackathons or client pitches

With DeployX, you can deploy your site in *minutes*, not hours.
